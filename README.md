# BookBot
This simple and humble Python application takes a book in the form of a text file, parses it, and returns the below statistics:
- Total word count
- Counts of individual characters appearing in the text

# Project Takeaway
BookBot helped me solidify handling files as input and parsing text in Python.

**I completed this project as part of the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) Backend Developer Course.**
